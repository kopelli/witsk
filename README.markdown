INSPIRATION
===========
Having worked in Visual Studio with the extension Intellicommand, being able to easily look up
what the keybindings available are is amazing. Unfortunately many programs don't make it easy
to discover what the keybindings are. Sometimes they're only listed in a webpage, sometimes
in the embedded help file, and sometimes they only way to discover them is by talking with
the developers. This isn't very helpful, especially if you find a useful command that you only use
a few times over a long period of time.
